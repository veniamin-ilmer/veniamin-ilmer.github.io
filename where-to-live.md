# Where to live

## Suburbs

I grew up in a suburb in New Jersey. Every morning I'd go outside onto a bus that would drive for about 20 minutes to my school, then take the bus for 20 minutes back home.

Everyone in the family - My father, my mother, myself, and my sister at some point needed to have our own personal car.

* Want to go to work? Drive to the bus stop. And the bus would take another 40 minutes to get to Jersey city. Then another 20 minutes to take the train to get to the office.
* Want to go to the store or restaurant? Drive.
* Want to go to the gym? Drive.

There was a nice forest that I could walk to, but it would take 30-40 minutes to walk to there, which is my limit for how far I'm willing to walk to get to somewhere.

I hated traffic. I kept wishing to live in a place where I didn't need to drive to get to everywhere.

I wished to be able to go to the store on the way home from work every day instead of having to stock up on food during the weekend.

## New York City

I subletted a very small room in chinatown. I worked 20 minutes away, both by train and by walking.

Although my room was very small, I was rarely home. Most of my time was spent walking outside, enjoying the sights, and going places with friends.

Everything was close by. Transportation was convenient. Life was good / interesting.

I made the following theory:

Everything in the city keeps changing. So to keep up with everyone, I shouldn't own anything. Instead, I should rent any services I need.

* Want to live somewhere? Rent. Then you can leave in a year if you want to move, instead of having to go through the long process of selling a house.
* Want transportation? Use a bus or rent a car. Better than having to think about parking and selling the car later.
* Want to go to the gym? Get a membership. If you find out it's not for you, you can cancel your membership instead of having to sell / throw out gym equipment.

I was under the impression that I'd always be renting anything I need.

## Oklahoma city

We rented out a newly built apartment in the middle of downtown oklahoma city.

The park was a 15 minute walk. Driving to work took 20 minutes.

The store was 10-20 minute drive.

Even though we still needed a car to get to places, it still felt convenient because of how fast you can get anywhere. No traffic.

Did I mention it was cheap? Living in downtown oklahoma city was cheaper than living in a suburb of new york.

As long as you can acquire work, life was good.

## Life with children

With my "rent everything" philosophy, I pushed that idea forward with my children.

Need to move somewhere that can fit a family? Why not rent a house?

..except things are not as simple as I'd liked.

Children are territorial. They don't like to move. They don't like change. They like habits.

My idea of "rent everything" starts to have cracks.

The whole point of renting a place, is that if you need to move, you can do so without much hassle. But if you are not going to move, due to children wanting a stable place to live, then that defeats the purpose of renting. Financially, it makes more sense to buy rather than rent if you expect to live in the same place for longer than 5 years.

Okay, if you are going to buy, then what kind of place do you want do own?

## House vs Apartment

When you rent an apartment, then any problem you have can be brought up to the Super. The super is paid a salary regardless of workload, so the super can spend time on maintenance work before something becomes a big problem.

When you rent a house, then any problem you have is brought up to the landlord, and the landlord can choose whether to send a licensed professional to fix problems. Unlike a Super, a specialist charges money any time they're asked to go anywhere. So houses end up with poor maintenance issues and only get repaired when a big problem arises.

So, if you want responsive maintenance, it is better to rent in an apartment rather than a house.

But what about buying?

In a building where everyone owns their own apartments, other problems can happen. Since the building does not manage the apartments, they take no responsibility in their repairs. So, if the water pipe starts leaking in the upstairs apartment, and damages the walls in my downstairs apartment, then I would have to try and ask for compensation from the upstairs neighbor. If the upstairs neighbor doesn't want to pay, then I'd have to sue the neighbor to get compensation.

So then, if buying, it makes sense to own your own house rather than an apartment.

Okay, what kind of house are you getting?

## Family house needs

A big question involving small children revolves around the daycare provider.

Per my "rent everything" philosophy, I should find a daycare. The problem is that the daycares nearby might not be as high enough quality as you'd want. And nannies are very expensive. Partly because rent and transportation is expensive for them.

Ah - but now that you own a house, if you have enough space, then you can have a nanny move in!

Per my "rent everything" philosophy, I should rent any activity for my children - gymnastics / soccer / swimming - whatever that's around, for monthly classes.

But.. someone still needs to bring the children to those activities. They can't walk there on their own. And if you need to drive there, then that requires a nanny that has a car..

So since you are buying a big house already, why not get one with a huge property that includes a pool, and trampoline? It's super convenient to have the kids run out into the backyard and play there. You don't need to drive anywhere.

It's ironic how a suburban house has become more convenient than an urban apartment.

## Back to the suburbs

A big property would be prohibitively expensive in the city. If you want to buy a big house, you have to live in a suburb, or rural location.

But wasn't I trying to avoid living in the suburbs this whole time?

I have to think hard about what are my needs, and how to get closer to them.

* Should I live near a public swimming pool, or have a private pool?
* How far to drive to the supermarket?
* How long does it take to work?
* How long does it take to get to a forest trail?

The closer I am to everything, the more expensive the land will be. However if I can pick and choose specific things I want to be near, and let go of everything else, then I can get a sweet deal.

If it is important for me to be able to walk to the grocery store, but everything else is unimportant, then I can find a grocery store in the middle of nowhere, and get a house right next to that store.

Effectively, by being really choosy about what I need and what I can do on my own property, and discarding everything else, I can get a cheap place where to live that meets my needs.

However, this place will probably not be in the city. The city offers a lot of services. Parks, stores, bars, and transportation to everywhere.

**If you are unsure what you want to do with your life, then a city is a good place to explore and find what you want.**

But if you know what you want in life, then you can find a place to live that has only the things you need, and it will be cheaper than living in the city.

## Coming full circle

My needs were different from my parent's. That is why I disliked living in the suburbs. It was inconvenient.

I moved to the city, and explored everything that was available. It was expensive, but worth it.

With children, it makes sense for me to move out somewhere that is close to what I need, and let go of everything else.

I imagine once my children grow up, they will find that place inconvenient, and they'd want to move into the city to explore what new conveniences are available.
