## Socially Conservative

### Ideals

Cultural unity is important. Everyone has a relatively similar background, culture, and/or religion. This similar culture helps people form close friendly communities in their neighborhoods, and look out for each other against people outside of their group.

Usually they idealize having large families, and hence it is important for everyone to have children.

This community is very protective of their culture, and want to stop outsiders with different cultures from intruding into their lives.

That is why they prefer to have a strong police unit, lenient gun regulations, but tight regulations on immigration.

Within their community, social conservatives are happy to share resources with eachother. They can be very generous to eachother.

### Unintended Consequences

Problems immerge when people with different cultures live among with social conservatives. Social conservatives perceive these outsiders poorly, and end up using discrimination, police, violence, and / or immigrations laws to try to remove the outsiders.

Although social conservatives are generous to eachother, they may try to stop government programs that provide social benefits to people outside of their group.

To try and protect themselves from outside influence, they might build borders to stop people from coming in the country, and have a large military.

## Socially Liberal

### Ideals

A diverse multicultural environment will mean that people can share their differing experiences to spawn more innovation and creativity.

This world can be viewed as a refuge. A safe haven for different types of people.

These people prefer to have lenient immigration laws, to try and boost diversity, with little or no borders/walls with other countries.

People value open-mindedness, openness to new experiences and ideas, openness to being challenged.

### Unintended Consequences

A multicultural environment makes it hard for strangers to trust each other. People might self-censor themselves to stop from accidently making someone of a different culture be uncomfortable. Certain topics become controversial to talk about. With most communication being shallow all of the time, people might end up with few or no close friends.

Sometimes laws can be poorly written to help certain minorities more than others, which may be viewed as unfair.

## Economically Conservative

### Ideals

Everyone has enough money to support themselves. This is done with stable / secure jobs, and government benefits.

There are a lot of strict consumer protection laws. Food and drugs has to pass through multiple screenings for contamination / adulteration / pathogens. Products need to pass through various regulation, fireproofing, childproofing, housing codes, etc. creating a very safe environment for all of the consumers.

The government monitors manufacturer's pollution output. Companies pay more for generating excess waste. Ideally, the environment will look very green, with drinkable rivers, and lush forests.

### Unintended Consequences

In order to ensure job security, the government may impose high trade tariffs on other countries. This may mean some foreign products are not available for purchase, or very expensive.

Because of all of the strict laws, small companies have difficulty maintaining all of the secure jobs, and passing through all of the inspections. Hence, most of the companies will be large, monopolistic, and frequently run by the government.

Big companies and big government are inefficient. There isn't much technological innovation. New products come out very slowly. People end up with slow, meaningless jobs.

People end up paying high taxes to sustain all of the government programs and inefficiency of large organizations. On average, people will have a poorer standard of living compared to other countries.

Government inefficiency might cause shortages and long queues for certain products. Product shortages might lead to bribes and discrimination.

## Economically Liberal

### Ideals

With lenient regulations, people can open small business, and build products and services efficiently.

With freedom to change and innovate, there is always new technology, making things more efficient.

This country will be able to outcompete others, leading the market, being a major product creators.

With low taxes, people are incentivised to try and generate as much income as possible. On average, people will have a richer standard of living compared to other countries.

### Unintended Consequences

Lack of job stability, competition for jobs, means that some people will be more successful than others at generating wealth. Eventually, there might be a large wealth gap between the rich and the poor.

A high wealth gap causes strangers to not trust each-other. There is less community involvement, more crime, people are less happy.

Lack of consumer protections and pollution regulations, will allow for some accidents to happen. Out of competition, companies may opt to lower costs by adulterating food or dump their trash into water ways.

Contaminated food, polluted rivers, preditory lending, marketing scams, can all slowly increase over time if there is low oversight.
