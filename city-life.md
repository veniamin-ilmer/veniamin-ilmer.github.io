# City life

A record of all of the cities I've lived in.

## New York City, NY

**Duration of Stay**: On and off at different parts of NY for about 11 years.

Most people work in Manhattan, however Manhattan is very expensive to live in, so most people live in the surrounding area.
The surrounding area (Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island, Long Island, and half of New Jersey), can be considered a suburb of Manhattan.

The few people who live in Manhattan usually don't own a car, because they can either walk or take the subway to get anywhere.

The further away people live, the worse the public transport is, and the higher chance they have a car.

The culture of Manhattan feels very materialist / consumerist. Especially in the tourist locations. Everything revolved around purchasing things. I disliked this culture.. it made me want to live a more minimalist lifestyle.

Everyone is so different in Manhattan, that you might feel out of place on your own.

Although it is a very safe place to live in, people generally build a bubble around themselves, ignoring everything around themselves, just focused on getting to their destinations.

It's not uncommon for someone to be yelling something about religion or politics to passerbyes, or for some massive construction project to be going on with dangerous looking cranes hanging around, and most people would completely ignore it, not remember it during their commute.

Frequently people had at least an hour of commuting time in one direction. Traffic was very common, and negatively affected everyone's mood.

Sometimes trains were sometimes filled so much, that you wouldn't be able to get squeeze inside. People sometimes waited multiple times for trains due to them being overcrowded. I sometimes took the train in the opposite direction, simply to get a spot on the train going back.

There are almost no alleyways in Manhattan, so all is usually placed in front of the building. Garbage trucks only come pickup the trash at certain times.. all other times, the trash just keeps piling up. There is signficant amount of trash, rats, and graffiti in Manhattan.

I found, Manhattan is basically the central hub of anything new. Any new product or service will probably be visible in Manhattan before any other place. A vivid example for me is some kind of sugar free soda. I remember it being sold in Manhattan for a few months, then I moved to Oklahoma. About a year later, I started seeing that soda appear in Oklahoma too.

My favorite location to hang out in has usually been in the Washington Square Park area. Filled mostly with New York University students, I enjoyed watching random things happen here all the time. A girl might come show off some cool hula hoop skills, a group of people might randomly start dancing, someone might be walking around with a horse head, etc.
I liked how this setting felt less consumerist than the rest of Manhattan.

With so many people, there was frequently something to see and do every day. I enjoyed walking around and watching everything around me. It was good exercise, without trying.

## Suburb in New Jersey

**Duration of Stay**: 14 years

Most of New Jersey is filled with houses and forest. It is hard to get to anywhere without a car. Most children get to school by an army of school busses.

A lot of the roads don't have sidewalks, so people walk on the car roadways.

New Jersey is known to have great schools, and high property taxes to pay for those schools. I went to school here. Although the school was not low on funding, I am not sure if I got the best education.

Most people I've talked to from New Jersey, don't like New Jersey. It feels just like a commuter city with lots of traffic. There is very little to do at home. People spend a lot of time going to malls. It's boring.

The closer you get to a big city, like Manhattan or Philadelphia, the worse the traffic gets.

New Jersey is infamous for having roads that drive to similar speeds as highways, but with traffic lights. It makes driving annoying.

The further away you get from a big city, the more rural it gets. There are tons of plant farmers in the rural parts of New Jersey. Rent is relatively cheap there, but few people want to live there since it's so far away from work.

I enjoyed walking around in the various forest trails everywhere. Closer to the poconos in pennsylvania, the more the mountainous trails appear, especially around the delaware river.

I wish there were a city with a mix between the mountainous trails and the NY city environment.
