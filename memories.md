## My earliest memory

I was 3 years old. My father was invited by his religious manager for shabbat.
The manager lived nearby. In the evening we started walking, my parents were holding my hands, side by side.
While walking, my parents would both lift me by my hands to jump over a curb or puddle. This gave me great joy.
The manager had a lot of kids. During the shabbat, they drank a significant amount of red wine.
In the morning, I woke up in a different location than usual. This was pretty unusual for me and it's probably why I remember this memory. We were in a room with a computer.
My mom later told me, as I recounted this memory, apparently some morning alarm went off, annoying everyone trying to sleep.
No one would turn off the alarm, due to it being shabbat.
So, we quietly left the house and went back home.

## NY apartment

Every day after work, my father would come from the train, and walk towards our building.
I'm not sure how, as there weren't cellphones back then, my dad would let my mom know that he got off the train.
She would then let me know to go to the window.
We had a window that faced the train. I would stand and watch through the window, and see my dad approaching.

The window also had a view into our little courtyard.
During the winter, I built a snowman with my dad. I was able to able to later see the snowman from the window.
My memory is fuzzy, but I think my mom actually threw us a carrot, from the window, so we can use it as a nose on the snowman.

One memory I have, shows me how relatively poor we were: We did not have a couch.
I sat on a mattress, that lay bare on the floor. We had a TV, that we found thrown out on a curb.
I got to watch that TV from the mattress. We continued to watch that same TV for a very long time. It was relatively big, and in color. Pretty expensive for that time.

My dad programmed the TV to turn off at around 9 PM? I used to watch sesame street, until it turned off. That's how I knew, it was time to go to sleep.

## Park

There was a park right across from our first building. I enjoyed going there all the time.
My favorite activity was to run. My favorite game was tag. I played it with other kids there.
I remember waiting to get onto the swings. While waiting, I would climb up and down the metal foundation of the swing.
There was a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-link_fencing](chain link fence) dividing different portions of the park.
My small foot would neatly fit inside of each diamond, allowing me to easily scale the fence. (I later realized I have a hard time scaling such fences due to my foot being too large to fit in the diamond.)
My "parkour skills" slowly developed there.
I liked challenging myself, climbing on higher and higher playground surfaces, then jumping to the ground, showing off to everyone how high I can jump.

When I was a little older, I would bike around the park.
The park was bordered by a bridge going over the Belt Parkway. The park, bridge, and parkway, caused there to be two paved slopes going down in each direction.
One slope was significantly steeper than the other. I frequently would bike down the easy slope, but would always be afraid to bike down the steeper slope, always slowing down along the way.

One time some kid in the park saw me biking around, and asked "can I see the bike?" I got off, and he took it, started biking around the park. I ran after him, partly making sure he doesn't steal the bike, partly because I enjoyed running to much. I got the bike back.

One day, in the park there was a pigeon, with its head disemboweled from the body. I was probably about 11 years old by now, but it was still quite unusual for me. I happen to be riding my bike, and some elderly woman saw me near the pigeon on my bike. She started yelling at me to get away, blaming me, as if I ran over the pigeon with the bike.

## Summer Pennsylvania

During the summer, my school gave about a month of vacation time. I usually would be sent to different places in upstate NY or Pennsylvania during this time, with my grandmother, aunt, cousin, and/or sister.

In Pennsylvania, my dad would rent out some small house, somewhere in the poconos. The house, although in a community of some kind, was kind far away from everything. There was a pool and lake we were able to get too, but it took a good hour or so to walk to there. I was very surprised how driving to there took about 5 minutes, yet walking took so long. I kept trying to find out from my grandmother if we were walking the long way and if the car was taking some shortcut.
The house was very old. There were two mushrooms growing in the hallway in the floor.

One time, I was outside in bright sun, picking some blackberries from bushes. Within very little time, the sky grew dark, there was a crack of lightening, I ran inside. This was followed by a strong thunderstorm, that lasted about 10 minutes, and then it cleared and was sunny again.

I happened to have a magnifying glass. I liked burning black marks with it in wood, or trying to chase down some bug with it.

## Upstate NY

A memorable location I've been to for about 2 or 3 summers has been a russian community / camp / resort in upstate NY called Сказка. I just found they have a website: http://www.skazka.us
This resort was considered a good place with fresh air. They had a pool, evening kid friendly dancing disco outside, and some other form of entertainment (piano playing, magician, etc.). No TV.
I had a friend playing with me there. I enjoyed the evening dancing, and pool swimming competition. I practiced several days in advanced before the competition. In retrospect, I was still pretty slow at swimming. :P
The pool maintainer frequently preached to everyone, to wash your feet before getting into the pool. There were a lot of leaves everywhere that would stick to people's feet and he kept being annoyed having to clean the leaves from the pool all the time.
Once, we found a frog in the pool trying to get out. We took it out.

Once every year, a magician came, and showed us tricks in the evening. One trick required two volunteers to hold up a curtain. My friend and I held up the certain, and got to see the "magic" behind the trick. The magician was tied up with a rope and lock, yet was able to something (I don't remember what) behind the curtain. When the curtain came down, everyone was amazed, not knowing how she did the trick. As a volunteer, I was able to see, the rope was very stretchy, like made out of rubber, so it was easy for the magician to do whatever they wanted under the rope. This was very funny to me, I was not able to contain my laughter, I was laughing out load through the whole act. But the magician had me wear a mask on my face, so the audience wasn't able to see what I was doing.

Lots of walking around with my grandma.
My grandmother liked to collect mushrooms, mint, stinging nettle, and other various semi-medicinal plants, usually making some kind of soup or other food with them.
Once she got quite angry at me:
The roll of toilet paper stood ontop of the toilet tank. After using the paper, I accidentally dropped the roll into the toilet.
The window in our bathroom was usually open, and I think the wind might have helped push the roll forward.
I accidentally dropped the roll about 3 times in total. She was very annoyed, as this would mean she'd have to explain to the maintenance people why she had a wet roll. I guess they didn't believe her initially, thinking she was trying to steal the rolls?
Apparently stealing free toilet rolls has been a soviet thing to do. My mom tells me when they first came to america, she was amazed how all of the public toilets had free paper.

One time, my sister was hanging out with a friend by the pool. From the distance, I heard her and her friend suddenly crying. At first, I thought they might have run into eachother or something. Apparently they found a wasp or bees nest, and decided to poke it with a stick. The two girls got stung all over. My sister was very sad. It took a long time to heal.
