# Cost of Low Maintenance

I bike to work every day, in a city that loves to drive.

My coworkers get to work in 20 minutes, while I take an hour.

Yet I enjoy it. Outside of the obvious monetary benefit of not needing to buy a car, I like how my commute usually includes a pleasant view and an automatic workout.

With the bike being the most important part of my commute, I started to read more about biking care and maintenance.

Researching the different froms of bikes has made me realize an important aspect about how modern products are made and sold.

Let's start with the basics: A new cheap generic bike will cost about $100.

These bikes are meant to be used casually. They are not the fastest, and they are likely to start having problems after significant use.

Yet, these bikes are relatively easily repairable. They require regular maintenance, but it's cheap.

I've thought a bit about this, and tried to understand, why isn't say a refrigerator similar to this?

Why do I have to send out a specialist to repair my fridge spending a lot of money, or end up just buying a new one instead?

I've come to the conclusion that it's because bikes are *meant to be toys or hobbies*.

People don't mind spending some time to repair their toy or hobby. An average bike is made to be easily maintainable.
