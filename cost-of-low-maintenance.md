# Cost of Low Maintenance

I bike to work every day, in a city that loves to drive.

My coworkers get to work in 20 minutes, while I take an hour.

Yet I enjoy it. Outside of the obvious monetary benefit of not needing to buy a car, I like how my commute usually includes a pleasant view and an automatic workout.

With the bike being the most important part of my commute, I started to read more about biking care and maintenance.

Researching the different froms of bikes has made me realize an important aspect about how modern products are made and sold.

Let's start with the basics: A new cheap generic bike will cost about $100.

These bikes are meant to be used casually. They are not the fastest, and they are likely to start having problems after significant use.

Yet, these bikes are relatively easily repairable. They require regular maintenance, but it's cheap.

I've thought a bit about this, and tried to understand, why isn't say a refrigerator similar to this?

Why do I have to send out a specialist to repair my fridge spending a lot of money, or end up just buying a new one instead?

I've come to the conclusion that it's because bikes are *meant to be toys or hobbies*.

People don't mind spending some time to repair their toy or hobby. As a result, the average bike is made to be easily maintainable.

Bike commuters, however, are more interested in the bike as a mode of transportation than as biking as a hobby.

If I have an important presentation scheduled for the morning, and my bike breaksdown half way, taking time to fix my bike would not be my top priority.

I'd probably try and get a ride with someone to not be late for my presentation.

I'd try and fix my bike later but I'd prefer to buy one that doesn't break down to start with.

Unlike the average bike user, commuters are much more interested in a mode of transportation that has little or no maintenance required.

So, what would that kind of bike look like? Here's where things get interesting.

The most common problem that could happen to a commuter bike, is that it gets a flat tire.

Unlike a car's thick layer of rubber, bike tires are more optimized for being light, cheap, and easy to replace.

It has a relatively thin layer of rubber, meaning a small screw can easily puncture it.

Luckily for commuters, who don't want to deal with fixing these thing, there are tires that will never go flat!

They are called [Airless tires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airless_tire).

They are less efficient than race tires. They are hard to replace. They are expensive.

But, they are maintenance free.

Just like tires, other parts of a bike can be modified to be maintenance free:

Instead of using the standard [derailleur gears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailleur_gears) that require regular oiling, you can get a miantenance free [hub gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_gear).
