# Defining myself

The purpose of this page is a self reflection. I hope I will be able to use this to decide how I should proceed with my life in the future.

## Who am I?

I am a very detail oriented person. I strive to understand the fundamentals of anything I study. Regardless of my age, I continue to view myself as a perpetual student.

Example of things I study are programming, analog electronics, mathematics, food health, wealth management, and basic linguistics.

I frequently question my fundamental assumptions about everything. Why is 0 * any number equal to 0? Are milk and eggs actually healthy? Why do computers work with 1 and 0 electric signals, and not 1, 0, and -1?

I have always prided myself about being physically fit (while being a nerd at the same time). When I was younger I did gymnastics, rock climbing, and parkour. Now-a-days, I just go out for long walks. They make me feel good. I look forward to being to doing outdoor activites with my kids as they grow up.

Raising children has significantly changed me. I am more patient. I am more adult. I understand the value of time and responsibility. I feel I can accomplish more things in life, always comparing it to raising children, as easy. Watching my kids grow has made me understand how people grow in general, especially from an emotional perspective.

I feel everyone has deep meaningful lives. I feel life is very valuable, and I feel bad that we instead usually value people based on their job and net worth.

I am lucky that my childhood interest in programming has given me a strong diverse career. I recognize that a lot of my, and probably most other people's, success is due to luck. Sure, my skillset has definitely developed over time, but a lot of lucky things helped me get here. It makes me feel bad about everyone else who was not as lucky.

I feel college was useful for a degree, but it hardly provided any educational value. I feel I missed out on sustaining friendships from college, simply by not asking for their phone numbers. I only realized this later in life, and regret it. I attempt to keep in touch with a few remaining contacts from previous jobs, but it is hard to maintain the long distance communication.

I think people usually have good intentions for everything they do. Unfortunately conflicts of interest may cause people to logically go against their good intentions, simply to get more money/power.
As a consequence, I have trust issues with doctors, dentists, lawyers, car mechanics, and anyone else who I would pay to do things for me, that I can't really verify myself. For such things, I can only trust my close friends. I am lucky my wife is a doctor. I will trust her word over anyone elses.

I feel most of humanities problems can be solved. However they don't get solved for centuries due to conflicts of interest. I feel politics will not be resolved simply by electing the right group of people into office. Instead it would require a collaborative effort to architect a new system of governance that minimizes conflicts of interest from the future people in power.

Although politically things usually seem to go in a poor direction, I am generally look towards the future with a positive outlook. The pace of emerging technology is increasing at an exponential rate. In this new millenium of year 2000, I feel like we are living in the future. With technologies like self driving vehicles, genetic engineering, and vertical farming, I hope that this will eventually lead us into a post-scarcity economy.
