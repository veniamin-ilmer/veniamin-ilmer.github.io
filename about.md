# Defining myself

I am a very detail oriented person. I strive to understand the fundamentals of anything I study. Regardless of my age, I continue to view myself as a perpetual student.

Example of things I study are programming, analog electronics, mathematics, food health, wealth management, and basic linguistics.

I am lucky that my detailed knowledge and interest in programming has given me a strong diverse career.

I frequently question my fundamental assumptions about everything. Why is 0 * any number equal to 0? Are milk and eggs actually healthy? Why do computers work with 1 and 0, for a positive and neutral signal, and not 1, 0, and -1?

I feel college was useful for a degree, but it hardly provided any educational value. I feel I missed out on sustaining friendships from college, simply by not asking for their phone numbers. I only realized this later in life, and regret it. I attempt to keep in touch with a few remaining contacts from previous jobs, but it is hard to maintain contact.

I feel everyone has deep meaningful lives. I think people usually have good intentions for everything they do.
Unfortunately conflicts of interest may cause people to reasonably go against their good intentions, simply to get more money/power.
As a consequence, I have trust issues with doctors, dentists, lawyers, car mechanics, and anyone else who I would pay to do things for me, that I can't really verify myself.
For such things, I can only trust my close friends. I am lucky my wife is a doctor. I will trust her word over anyone elses.

I feel most of humanities problems can be solved technologically, but end up not being solved for centuries due to conflicts of interest. I feel that this issue will not be resolved simply by electing the right group of people with good intentions. Instead it would require a collaborative effort to architect a system of governance that minimizes all forms of conflicts of interest from the future people in power.

Raising children has significantly changed me. I am more patient. I am more adult. I understand the value of time and responsibility. I feel I can accomplish more thing in life, always comparing it to raising children, as easy. Watching my kids grow has made me understand how people grow in general, especially from an emotional perspective.

I have always prided myself about being physically fit (while being a nerd at the same time.) When I was younger I did gymnastics, rock climbing, and parkour. Now-a-days, I just go out for long walks. They make me feel good. I look forward to being to doing outdoor activites with my childs as they grow up.
