## Socially Conservative

### Ideals

Cultural unity is important. Everyone has a relatively similar background, culture, and/or religion. This similar culture helps people form close friendly communities in their neighborhoods, and look out for each other against people outside of their group.

Usually they idealize having large families, and hence it is important for everyone to have children.

This community is very protective of their culture, and want to stop outsiders with different cultures from intruding into their lives.

That is why they prefer to have a strong police unit, lenient gun regulations, but tight regulations on immigration.

Within their community, social conservatives are happy to share resources with eachother. They can be very generous to eachother.

### Unintended Consequences

Problems immerge when people with different cultures live among with social conservatives. Social conservatives perceive these outsiders poorly, and end up using discrimination, police, violence, or immigrations laws to try to remove the outsiders.

Although social conservatives are generous to eachother, they may try to stop government programs that provide social benefits to people outside of their group.

To try and protect themselves from outside influence, they might build borders to stop people from coming in the country, and have a large military.

## Socially Liberal

### Ideals

A diverse multicultural environment will mean that people can share their differing experiences to spawn more innovation and creativity.

This world can be viewed as a refuge. A safe haven for different types of people.

These people prefer to have lenient immigration laws, to try and boost diversity, with little or no borders/walls with other countries.

People value open-mindedness, openness to new experiences and ideas, openness to being challenged.

### Unintended Consequences

A multicultural environment makes it hard for strangers to trust each other. People might self-censor themselves to stop from accidently making someone of a different culture be uncomfortable. Certain topics become controversial to talk about. With most communication being shallow all of the time, people might end up with few or no close friends.

Sometimes laws can be poorly written to help certain minorities more than others, which may be viewed as unfair.

## Economically Conservative

### Ideals

Everyone has stable / secure jobs. The government

### Unintended Consequences

In order to ensure job security, the government may have high trade tariffs with other countries.
