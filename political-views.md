## Social Conservative

### Ideal World

Everyone has a relatively similar background, culture, and/or religion. This similar culture helps people form close friendly communities in their neighborhoods, and look out for each other against people outside of their group.

Usually they idealize having large families, and hence it is important for everyone to have children.

This community is very protective of their culture, and want to stop outsiders with different cultures from intruding into their lives.

That is why they prefer to have a strong police unit, lenient gun regulations, but tight regulations on immigration.

Within their community, social concervatives are happy to share resources with eachother. They can be very generous to eachother. However, they will not be generous to people outside of their community.

### Unintended Consequences

Problems immerge when people with different cultures live among with social conservatives. Social conservatives perceive these outsiders poorly, and end up using discrimination, police, or immigrations laws to try to remove the outsiders.

Social conservatives may try to stop government programs that provide social benefits to people outside of their group.

## Social Liberal

### Ideal World

A diverse multicultural environment will mean that people can share their differing experiences to spawn more innovation and creativity, than would be possible with a monolithic culture.

These people prefer to have lenient immigration laws, to try and boost diversity. Minorities might get extra benefits to try and give them a fair environment compared to the privileged majority.

### Unintended Consequences

A multicultural environment makes it hard for strangers to trust each other. People might self-censor themselves to stop from accidently making someone of a different culture be uncomfortable. Certain topics become controversial to talk about. With most communication being shallow all of the time, people might end up with few or no close friends.
