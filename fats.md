# Fats

What are good fats and bad fats?

The science behind this is lacking. Some things we know are true. Some things need more study.

Below is everything I know about fats, for your reference.

## What does it mean for a fat to be bad?

It means it will raise your LDL level and lower your HDL level, which will increase the chance of you having a blood clot, which will cause heart problems.

## What does it mean for a fat to be good?

In addition to reversing the effects of the bad fats, some good fats are also [essential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid), which means you need to eat enough of them every day, just like a vitamin.

## Types of fats

All fats can be divided into these categories:

* Monounsaturated Fats
* Polyunsaturated Fats
  * Omega 3
  * Omega 6
* Trans fats
  * "Good Trans Fats"
  * "Bad Trans Fats"
* Saturated Fats
  * "Good Saturated Fats"
  * "Bad Saturated Fats"

Generally, trans fats and saturated fats are solid at room temperature, while monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature.

## Monounsaturated Fats

There seems to be consensus among the scientific community, that all monounsaturated fats are good for you. There are no bad monounsaturated fats.

List of foods with high amounts of monounsaturated fats:
* Macademia nuts
* Mustard seed
* Rapeseed (Canola Oil)
* Avocado
* Olive oil

## Polyunsaturated Fats

Neither Omega 3 nor Omega 6 are "good" or "bad". Rather, you need to eat a correct ratio of these two fats to be healthy.

Most polyunsaturated fats are higher in omega 6 than omega 3. This is because of shelf life. Foods that have a longer shelf life, generally have a higher omega 6 ratio. Foods with a higher omega 3 ratio go bad faster.

So you need to compensate by eating foods with higher omega 3 amounts. Generally at least a 4 to 1 ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 is recommended.

List of oil rich foods with omega 3 higher than omega 6:

* Any oily fish
* Flax seed
* Chia seed

List of oil rich foods with omega 6 signficantly higher than omega 3:

* Sunflower oil
* Sesame oil
* Corn oil
* Most "Vegetable oil"

Note that non-fish omega 3 based oils have a low smoke point and are not good for frying. They are better for salads.

## Trans fats

### Good Trans Fats

Good trans fats are those that are found in nature. Vaccenic Acid is a well known good trans fatty acid, found it human breast milk.

Butter can have about 3% trans fat. This is good trans fat.

Another good trans fat is Conjugated Linoleic Acid, which is found mostly in the meat and dairy products derived from ruminant animals.

### Bad Trans Fats

Food processing companies make trans fats with a process called hydrogenation. They do this because it makes the food last longer. But it is not good for you.

Companies are known to hide their trans fats from the nutrition label by rounding it amount down to 0 grams. The way to tell if there are any trans fats is by checking for the words "hydrogenated oil" or "partially hydrogenated oil" in the ingredients listing.

The primary location you would find bad trans fats is in margarine, vegetable shortening, and any foods made with these products.

## Saturated Fats

This is the most controversial of all fats. You would have to look at the individual fatty acids to see if the saturated fat is good or not.

### Good Saturated Fats

The following are known to be good saturated fats

* Lauric acid C12:0 (High in Coconut oil and Palm Kernel Oil)
* Myristic acid C14:0 (High in Nutmeg butter)
* Stearic acid C18:0 (High in Cocao butter)

### Bad Saturated Fats

* Palmitic acid C16:0 (High in Palm oil, and most meats)

Unfortunatly, most foods that have Saturated Fat are high in the bad kind of Saturated Fat, Palmitic acid.
That is why, generally people avoid all foods with high saturated fat.

Make sure not to confused Palm Oil with Palm Kernel Oil. These are different.
